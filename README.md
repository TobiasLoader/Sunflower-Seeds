# Sunflower-Seeds
A program which plots seeds based on increments in rotation. Inspired by Numberphile. The most efficient packing is done with the rotation increment being the reciprocal of an irrational number (the least well approxiamated numbers). Therefore by definition, phi being 1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+...))) cannot be truncated at any one point to create a well approximated value. It therefore has the  densest packing, and the sunflower models this pattern.
